# SurvivalPrediction
In this repository we test various machine learning approaches for best Titanic dataset Survival Prediction.
Titanic Dataset is in saved CVS file format.
I cleaned the dataset first and divided it into training, validation, and testing sections.


Approaches tested:
 - Logestic Regression (LR)
 - MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)
 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 - Gradient Boosting (GB)
 - Random Forest (RF)
